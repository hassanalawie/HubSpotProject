Hey! ðŸ¤ 
In the spirit of HubSpot's dynamic culture, I put together this Customer Success Dashboard in about an hourâ€”my quick tribute to a company that champions transparency and customer-centric innovation. It was a fun challenge to see what I could craft in a short amount of time while staying true to HubSpot's values. This project is a light-hearted nod to that ethos, showcasing a blend of analytical utility and the agility to create on the fly. It's about embracing the data-driven approach HubSpot is known for, with a bit of flair for good measure.
